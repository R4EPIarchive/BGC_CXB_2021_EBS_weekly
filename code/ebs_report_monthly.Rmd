/// Data cleaning \\\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This part of the script will create and clean variables in your data.

All your cleaning and variable creation should happen in these chunks.
That way, in case something goes wrong, you can push the small arrow at the top
of the chunk to re-run all the code chunks up to the current one.

The chunks are:
- standardise_dates -- will set up and clean dates.
- create_vars       -- creates variables based on other variables

You must adapt this section according to your data!

# Summary  
This community event-based surveillance (EBS) report covers topics of cluster of illness, cluster of death or increased death, unusual health events, and livestock diseases in Cox's Bazar in `r reporting_month` 

## Reporting   
  - During `r reporting_month`, there were a total of `r nrow(total_signals_received)` signals received of which `r nrow(total_signals_investigated)` signals were investigated by the Epidemiology Alert Team (EAT) and  `r nrow(verified_signals_investigated)` verified.  `r prop_chv`% of signals were identified by HP Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) or directly by the Epi team (`r prop_eat`%). There is `r trend_investigated_signals` trend in investigated signals compared to total in `r previous_month` (`r nrow(total_signals_investigated_previous2months)`). The teams made `r number_referred_total %>% pull(Referred)` verbal referrals to the person's nearest health facility, including `r number_referred_fu_total %>% pull(Referred_FU)` people who required follow up at MSF OCA facility. `r nrow(risk_as)` risk assessments were done and `r nrow(risk_as_resp)` events were classified as more than minimal risk  (minor-severe) requiring additional response and resources- see attachments.

  - `r nrow(illness_signals_investigated)` outbreak-prone illness signals were investigated in `r reporting_month`, of which `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, total_event_detail == "AFP")` AFP,  `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, total_event_detail == "AJS")` AJS, `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, total_event_detail == "AWD")` AWD, `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, total_event_detail == "Diphtheria")` Diphtheria,  `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, total_event_detail == "Measles")` measles and `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, total_event_detail == "Menigitis")` meningitis. `r fmt_count(illness_signals_investigated, signal_status == "Verified")` of the illness signals were verified by the EAT. The total illness signals investigated in `r reporting_month` is `r trend_investigated_illness_signals` compared to the `r previous_month` total of `r  nrow(illness_signals_investigated_previous2months)`.

## Suspected COVID-19 cases  
   - During `r reporting_month`, `r nrow(covid19_signals_investigated)` signals for suspected COVID-19 were investigated and `r fmt_count(covid19_signals_investigated, verification_how_many_people >= 2)` of them were clusters of two or more cases. There is `r trend_investigated_covid_signals ` in `r reporting_month` compared to the `r previous_month` total of (`r nrow(covid19_signals_investigated_previous2months)`)
   
## Unusual health events  
  - During `r reporting_month`, there was a total of `r nrow(unusual_event_signals_investigated)` unusual health events investigated. Among them `r fmt_count(unusual_event_signals_investigated, signal_status == "Verified")` were verified. `r fmt_count(unusual_event_signals_investigated, chv_signals_eventdescription == "Skin disease" & signal_status == "Verified")` of verified signal were skin disease.


## Deaths  
  - There were a total of `r nrow(death_signals_investigated)` deaths investigated, of which `r fmt_count(death_signals_investigated, verification_how_many_people == 1)` single deaths and `r fmt_count(death_signals_investigated, verification_how_many_people >= 2)` clusters of deaths investigated. `r fmt_count(death_signals_investigated, total_event == "Suspected COVID death")` ARTI/suspected COVID-19 death signals were investigated and `r nrow(verified_covid_deaths)` were verified.
  
# Recommendations  
  - Risk assessment for `r thresholda %>% pull(total_event_detail)` in camp `r thresholda %>% pull(chv_signals_camp)` since there  were `r thresholda %>% pull(n)` clusters in this camp in the reporting week
  
  - Risk assessment for `r thresholdb %>% pull(total_event_detail)` in camp `r thresholdb %>% pull(chv_signals_camp)` since there was 1 large cluster that affected `r thresholdb %>% pull(verification_how_many_people)` people.

<!-- ## Map -->
<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// read_shapefiles \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create maps, you need to have a shapefile of the area. Often, the MSF GIS
unit can provide shapefiles.

Your shapefile can be a polygon or points. Polygons do not need to be contiguous.

The names of the polygons or points MUST match the names in your linelist.

Your coordinate reference system needs to be WGS84.

# Annex 1: EBS definitions and responsibilities

**Signal**  A signal is reported data or information that represents a potential acute risk to human health. It is transmitted immediately and has not yet been verified as to whether or not it meets the case or event definition of the surveillance system. Signals are reported by CHVs, WHPs and TBAs.
**Verified signal**: Reported information that meets the formal signal definition. The EAT members verify the signals the day after they are reported. The epidemiologist reviews all verified signals to decide whether a risk assessment is required.
**Alert**: An alert will refer to a public health event that has been i) verified and ii) risk assessed and iii) requires an intervention (an investigation, a response or a communication)
**Response** A rapid response team is deployed and could conduct activities such as active case finding, vaccination, health promotion, WASH-related activities and case management  

  i)	Where teams are mobilized for the purpose of response against their routine activities  
  
  ii) New resources are mobilized or materials prepared
  
  iii) Communication done specifically for the alert

Response could be through:  (1) Routine epi teams, (2) Health promotion teams with special focus on the specific alert (3) Epi, WatSan and HP teams for alerts that require a combined response

HAO and Advocacy teams for alerts that need external communication


# Annex 2: Proposed threshold definitions
In order to make the EBS system more useful and relevant for the project, it is necessary to have a simple flagging system to be able to alert other team members of significant information. In the EBS SOP, there was a plan for risk assessments (to categorise alerts between minimal to severe risk) of verified signals by an assessment team in discussion with MTL/Medco/WASHCO- this step as well as the subsequent RRT deployment steps are currently missing. In part, this is due to the sheer volume of verified signals in this setting. In weeks 25- 34 we had 216 verified signals that EAT members reported required a response but no other actors were currently responding to. Typical EBS risk assessment steps are better suited to ad hoc early warning reports of acute public health events. With this in mind, we are proposing an intermediary step to filter ‘routine’ alerts from unusual alerts that are more likely to require a risk assessment in the camps. However, given that other examples of how to do this in an MSF setting aren’t available, any feedback is very welcome! The below thresholds are a proposal for a way to filter alerts that would be indicative of geographically clustered transmission at camp-level, increasing transmission or high numbers of people affected- beyond what is typical for the setting. 

<!-- ## Table 1 -->
<!-- Create summary table of total verified signals by camp -->
## Threshold A: Most number of clusters per event type and camp in reporting month
The camp with the highest number of clusters per event type in `r reporting_month` is camp `r thresholda %>% pull(chv_signals_camp)` with `r thresholda %>% pull(n)` clusters of `r thresholda %>% pull(total_event_detail)` 

```{r threshold_A, fig.height = 3}
#Select highest/most concerning given context and describe whether risk assessment is required in the recommendation section

ebs_verified %>% 
  ## only keep signals reported during the reporting week 
  filter(month_signal == reporting_month) %>% 
  ## only keep signals that require a response
  filter(verification_do_you_think_response_is_requi == "yes")  %>%
  ## only keep signals where no other actor is responding
  filter(verification_is_there_any_other_organizatio == "no")  %>%
  ## select variables to use for table
  select("Signal type"= total_event_detail, 
         chv_signals_camp) %>% 
  ## use tbl_summary from gtsummary package to make table
  tbl_summary(by = chv_signals_camp, 
              missing = "no")  %>% 
  bold_labels() %>% 
  as_gt() %>%
  gt::gtsave(filename= "thresholda.png", path = here::here("2021", 
                                                           "4_output", 
                                                           "archive"))

```


## Threshold B: Largest clusters
The largest single cluster in `r reporting_month` was for `r thresholdb %>% pull(total_event_detail)` in camp `r thresholdb %>% pull(chv_signals_camp)` that affected `r thresholdb %>% pull(verification_how_many_people)` people.

```{r threshold_B}
ebs_verified %>%
  ## only keep signals reported during the reporting week 
  filter(month_signal == reporting_month) %>% 
  ## only keep signals that require a response
  filter(verification_do_you_think_response_is_requi == "yes")  %>%
  ## only keep signals where no other actor is responding
  filter(verification_is_there_any_other_organizatio == "no")  %>%
  group_by(chv_signals_camp) %>%
  filter(verification_how_many_people == max(verification_how_many_people) ) %>% 
              select("Camp"= chv_signals_camp,"signal type"= total_event_detail,  verification_how_many_people) %>%
  arrange(desc( verification_how_many_people)) %>%
  rename("Largest cluster- number of people"= verification_how_many_people) %>% 
  kable()
  

```
